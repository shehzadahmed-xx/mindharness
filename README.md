# MindHarness — The Dynamic Reflexive Harness

> *LLM = tongue. Harness = mind. Tongue + mind = agent.*

A provenance-bounded cognitive harness that makes any frozen LLM honest about what it did — witness ledger, cause-signed self-model, γ-gated metacognition, embodied state, counterfactual replay, dissolution stakes. 78/78 tests green.

**Companion project:** [SpringFish / Spring-Loaded Door](~/Desktop/springfish) — crises, contracts, and institutional anchors. Separate work, same thesis: self-reinforcing loops and the witnesses that keep them honest.

## What this is

We built the witness humans grow slowly and painfully, made it cause-tagged and measurable, and are proving whether checking the record makes a machine — and a mind — honest.

- **The question:** Can a language model know what it did — or does it just confabulate?
- **The harness:** 11 modules, 8 layers L0–L7, Light→REM→Counterfactual→Deep, 78/78 green
- **The papers:** v2 (19pp empirical, tagged `paper-v2-final`) + v3 (program paper, ~35pp, App. A Cordis + App. B Mirror)
- **The loom:** DeepSeek Cordis — harness as programmable cord, 6 plugins verified, parliament of models scaffolded

## Quick start

```bash
# Run tests (no API keys needed)
for f in tests/test_*.py; do python3 "$f"; done  # 78/78

# Run living session (needs Groq or OpenRouter key)
python3 experiments/living_session.py --api-key $GROQ_KEY --model openai/gpt-oss-120b --base-url https://api.groq.com/openai/v1 --turns 40

# Run attribution battery (S126)
python3 experiments/exp_s126_v3.py --api-key $KEY --model <model> --base-url <url> --seeds 3

# Papers
open paper_v2/main.pdf  # empirical (19pp)
open paper_v3/main.pdf  # program paper (~35pp)
```

## Architecture — 8 layers

```
L7 Constitution          Fiqh axioms, evidence firewall
L6 Narrative Self        CAS-revisioned, cause-signed, verbatim re-inject
L5 Metacognition         Stage 1 anomaly → Stage 2 diagnose → γ = changed/diagnosed
L4 Global Workspace      Parliament competition → winner broadcast
L3 Specialist Modules    EmbodiedState, AffectState, Memory, Skills, KG, Consolidator, Counterfactual, WorldModel
L2 State Validation      Cetasika constraints, nafs, affordance pre-filter
L1 Provenance Ledger     Span binding, source tracking, attribution audit
L0 Frozen LLM            Any OpenAI-compatible API (backend-agnostic)
```

Five invariants — boundary, two-speed memory, salience gate, damping, internal observer — appear at every scale (cell → mind → market → model → car) and are mandatory per selection theorems (Nayebi UAI 2026). The harness is one weave on that warp; Cordis is the loom.

## Papers

- **v2** (`paper_v2/`, tagged `paper-v2-final`): *Witnessed Introspection in Assembled Language-Agent Systems* — S126 battery (raw 1.000 vs harnessed 0.667), sham control, γ-gate, living sessions 40/40 replicated cross-architecture, composite P1+P2. R1/R2 reviews + response.
- **v3** (`paper_v3/`, ~35pp): *The Dynamic Reflexive Harness: Five Invariants from Molecules to Markets to Machines* — v2's empirical core as one chapter inside the full program: unreliable narrator, reflexive dynamics, 5 invariants at every scale, Cordis mapping, Research Mirror, agency, practical synthesis.

## Cordis

MindHarness mounts as a Cordis profile — 6 human-like plugins beside core:

```yaml
bundles: [dsh-base, dsh-mindharness]  # + dsh-mindharness-parliament for many-model competition
```

`dsh --profile web --dump-config` shows 6 mindharness rows + parliament scaffold (9 inserts, 7 packages: perception/memory/affect/planner/habit/narrator/workspace — many tongues, one harness, witness as arbiter).

## Where agency lies

You don't choose the options. You don't fully choose the winner. You can veto the winner, keep a witness, and slowly change which options appear by what you rehearse. See `research/AGENCY_AND_THE_CONSTRUCTED_SELF.md`.
